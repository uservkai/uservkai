<h2>🚀 About Me</h2>

<p>
I am a learner of the <strong>ALX Software Engineering Program</strong> and I'm passionate about building scalable backend systems that create real-world impact. My journey into software engineering began with a deep curiosity for how technology powers the systems behind banking, finance, and digital economies.
</p>

<p>
With hands-on experience in <strong>digital marketing</strong> and <strong>Web3-aligned product launches</strong>, I bring a unique cross-disciplinary perspective to tech—where communication, strategy, and backend logic all matter.
</p>

<p>
🔭 I’m currently exploring how backend technologies can enable inclusive financial tools and applications that support economic resilience and transparency.  
💡 What inspires me is the opportunity to build code that matters—where systems serve people, and innovation drives impact.
